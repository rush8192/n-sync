1) Replica Failover

Sunday/Monday
Rush:
1) Master failover

Before Paper:
1) LRU Cache on Disk
2) Better way to get master/replica time estimates
3) Try joining to playing music right after recovery: not sure if possible with pygame
4) Separate load service for bulk load so client doesn't have to wait (no guarantees it'll finish, but attempt to create cache) / Whisper protocol (can be used for stagger recovery)
5) Save playlist to disk on replicas

Future Work after paper:
1) P2P File Distribution: Stagger recovery?
2) Client front end
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
3) ZeroMQ/C++ Music Server?
