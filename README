CS 244B: Distributed Systems Autumn 2014
Final Project

NSync: Distributed, synchronized music player that uses consensus
and the Berkeley Time Algorithm to acheive a high degree of accuracy.
Clients select a series of songs to be played and send PLAY, PAUSE,
FORWARD, and BACKWARD commands.

Designed to smoothly handle n failures in a cluster with (2n+1) nodes.
Implemented as several different flask services: master, client, and
recovery.

Also provides client the ability to replicate mp3 files to different nodes, so
the client can provide additional music files on the fly.
